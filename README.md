<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](./images/demo.jpg)

Developed with NextJS + NestJS.<br/>
We used nextjs for the frontend and nestjs for the backend.<br/>
The backend recorded label and URL in postgres.<br/>
For the backend, I used the one from Image-uploader-master.<br/>
(https://github.com/masa-fullstack/image-uploader-master)<br/>
<br/>
For the NextJS template, I used the NextJS Typescript Boilerplate from the official examples.<br/>
<br/>
For CSS, I used Tailwindcss.<br/>
During development, I used docker-compose to build the development environment.<br/>

Thanks for viewing :)
